## 👋 Introduction
I still remember the first time I heard about **GitHub**.  
It was during one of my early coding projects when a teammate said, *“Push it to GitHub.”*  
Back then, I honestly had no idea what that meant.  

Fast forward to now, and I can’t imagine working on any project without **Git and GitHub**.  
In this blog, I want to share my experience of learning these tools and why I think they’re a must for every developer.

## 🛠 The Git Confusion
When I first installed Git, I was completely lost.  
Commands like `git init` and `git add` felt like alien language. I remember typing things and then panicking because nothing happened (or worse, I broke my project 😅).

But slowly, it started to click:
- **Git tracks changes** → like a timeline for your code.
- **Branches** → let you experiment without breaking the main project.
- **Commits** → tiny “save points” you can jump back to.

Once I realized Git was basically a *safety net*, I stopped being afraid of it.

## 🌍 Discovering GitHub
After Git, the next step was GitHub.  
At first, I just saw it as a “cloud folder for code,” but it’s way more powerful.  

With GitHub, I could:
- Share projects with friends
- Get feedback through **Pull Requests**
- See issues and actually contribute to open source
- Build a profile that shows my coding journey  

It almost felt like social media for developers — but instead of selfies, we share code.

## 💡 The Commands I Use Daily
I don’t use all of Git’s fancy commands, but these became my daily routine:

```bash
# Start a project
git init

# Save changes
git add .
git commit -m "my update"

# Create a branch
git checkout -b new-feature

# Send to GitHub
git push origin new-feature
